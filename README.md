Note, that there are lots of changes in 0.5 branch at moment. Some things will change (for example ZeroMQ won't be supported by main package), some will be improved. But the idea is still the same. See the list of upcoming changes [here](https://github.com/FZambia/centrifuge/blob/0.5/src/README.md)

CENTRIFUGE
==========

Simple real-time messaging in web applications.

The main goal of Centrifuge is the same as of [Pusher](http://pusher.com/) or
[Pubnub](http://www.pubnub.com/) services. The main difference is that Centrifuge is
open-source and requires installation. Centrifuge is most similar to
[Faye](http://faye.jcoglan.com/)

Centrifuge is built on top of [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/) -
extremely fast and mature Python's async web server.

Centrifuge uses [ZeroMQ](http://www.zeromq.org/) steroid sockets for internal
communication and publish/subscribe operations. There is also support
for [Redis](http://redis.io/) PUB/SUB, so you can use it instead of ZeroMQ.
You can also run full-featured instance of Centrifuge without extra dependencies
on ZeroMQ and Redis - in this case you are limited in using only SINGLE instance
of Centrifuge.

To connect to Centrifuge from browser pure [Websockets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)
or [SockJS](https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client) library can be
used.

Centrifuge comes with administrative web interface to manage project/namespace
structure and monitor important messages.

Persistent data (projects, namespaces) by default stored in [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) database.
But when running Centrifuge instance processes on different machines you should use [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)
or [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) backends instead of SQLite.

Please,

* read the [documentation](https://centrifuge.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
* look at [examples](https://github.com/FZambia/centrifuge/tree/master/examples).


Main features
-------------

* Asynchronous backend on top of Tornado
* Different backends for PUB/SUB operations
* SockJS and pure Websockets endpoints
* Simple javascript client
* Presence and history data for channels
* Web interface for managing your projects
* Flexible channel settings through namespaces


Basic usage from browser
------------------------

```javascript
var centrifuge = new Centrifuge({
    url: 'http://localhost:8000/connection',  // Centrifuge SockJS connection endpoint
    token: 'TOKEN', // token based on project's secret key, project ID and user ID
    project: 'PROJECT_ID', // project ID from Centrifuge admin interface
    user: 'USER_ID' // your application user ID (can be empty for anonymous access)
});

centrifuge.on('connect', function() {

    console.log('connected');

    var subscription = centrifuge.subscribe('django', function(message) {
        // message from channel received
        console.log(message);
    });

    subscription.on('ready', function(){
        subscription.presence(function(message) {
            // information about who connected to channel at moment received
        });
        subscription.history(function(message) {
            // information about last messages sent into channel received
        });
        subscription.on('join', function(message) {
            // someone connected to channel
        });
        subscription.on('leave', function(message) {
            // someone disconnected from channel
        });
    });

});

centrifuge.on('disconnect', function(){
    console.log('disconnected');
});

centrifuge.connect();
```

To run tests type the following from `tests` directory (`centrifuge` must be in PYTHONPATH):

```python
# IMPORTANT! Tests clear Redis database on every running. Be aware of this.
python -m unittest discover -p 'test_*.py'
```

Contributing
------------

Pull requests are welcome! But, please, follow next principles:

* keep things as simple as possible
* pep8
* python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3 compatible

P.S. If BSD license of Centrifuge does not allow you to use it, tell me and I'll consider to change license.
